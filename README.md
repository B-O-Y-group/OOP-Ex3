# OOP-Ex3

This project is about directed weight graph in python 

#add gui HERE 



#The Algorithm : 



#shortest_path
  Returns the shortest path from node id1 to node id2 using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
  by going throw all the node and the edge in graph and update every node distance 
  we can find the shorted path between every two node .
        
        
#centerPoint
This algorithm using dijkstra and search for each node the maximum weight from him to all the other  
and then search for the minimum of all the max weight of each 
the return is the node we find .

#TSP
This method solve the problem "Traveling Salesman Problem"
by trying all the Combinations of the faster routes for every node
in the list we can find the best of them .
